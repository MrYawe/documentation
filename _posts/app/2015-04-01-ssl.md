## *.scalingo.io domain

By default you can access your application using the following domain name:
\<yourapp\>.scalingo.io.

HTTPS is enabled by default for those domains and we recommend you to use it by
default to ensure the encryption of the requests to your apps.

We provide a valid certificate which is recognized by all modern browsers and
HTTP clients.

If you have a custom domain configured, you can also choose to use your own
certificate, in which case it is handled by **SNI** on our side. To understand
what it is and why it's useful, you can read more here:
[SNI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_Name_Indication).

## Custom domain

You can add [your own domain name]({% post_url 2015-04-01-domain %}) to
access your application. By default HTTPS is also enabled, but accessing your
application with HTTPS would result in a warning of your browser.

To solve this issue, you have to use your own certificate with your domain.
Different steps have to be followed.

  <strong>Adding an SSL/TLS certificate on your custom domain is free on Scalingo.</strong>
</blockquote>

### 1. Create a RSA key pair and a signing request

```
openssl req -new -newkey rsa:2048 -sha256 -nodes -keyout app.key -out app.csr
```

You have to enter different information concerning your certificate, but have
particular look at:

* __Country Name__: It has to be the two letters representing your country following the
[ISO 3166-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2)
* __Common Name__: This is the domain name you want to secure. (Example: `www.example.com`)

Two files have been generated:

* `app.key`: The private key, you have to keep secret
* `app.csr`: The signing request, which has to be signed by a trusted third-party

> This command creates a RSA key of 2048 bytes length, you can adapt this
> value if you wish a stronger key. However, we do not recommend you to use a
> lower encryption key size.

### 2. Submit your request to generate a valid certificate

Your `app.csr` file has to be signed by an external entity. This service is, in most
of the cases, charged by the authority. But some companies are providing certificates
for free.

* [StartSSL](https://www.startssl.com/)
* [Comodo](https://ssl.comodo.com)
* [InstantSSL](https://www.instantssl.com/)
* [Digicert](https://www.digicert.com/ssl-certificate.htm)

Those are examples, a lot of other companies are providing this service.

### 3. Upload your key and certificate

> Not that both your key and your certificate must be in the [PEM
> format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy-enhanced_Electronic_Mail)

You can use our [command line utility](http://cli.scalingo.com) or our web dashboard
to achieve this operation.

With the CLI:

```bash
# If the doman has already been defined
scalingo domains-ssl --cert ./app.crt --key ./app.key www.example.com

# If it is a new domain
scalingo domains-add --cert ./app.crt --key ./app.key www.example.com
```

From our dashboard:

Go to the 'Domain' tab of your application, click on the gear of the concerned domain,
select the certificate you want to use and the key, then click on 'Validate'.

In both cases the modification is applied instantly.

## How to upload certificate chains

A lot of certificate authorities are providing certificate chains or bundles alongside your signed certificate. To upload all those certificates, you have to create one file, with all the certificates concatenated. First add your certificate, then append all the intermediate certificates of the certificate chain.

Example:

```bash
===== BEGIN CERTIFICATE ======
.... your certificate
===== END CERTIFICATE ========
===== BEGIN CERTIFICATE ======
.... intermediate certificate 1
===== END CERTIFICATE ========
===== BEGIN CERTIFICATE ======
.... intermediate certificate 2
===== END CERTIFICATE ========
```

## Let's encrypt

A Let's encrypt addon is planned for late 2016, but we do not support it now. For the moment, you must use a traditionnal SSL support (i.e. StartSSL has a free 1year SSL certificate).
